* Why Java 8?
  Introduced major language and runtime enhancements -> improved productivity, performance, and code readability.
  Minimal code
  Java isn't a pure functional language, 
  but with Java 8 features like lambdas, streams, and Optional, 
  it supports many functional programming principles.
  Introduced lambda expression, streams, Date & Time API
  Default and Static Methods in Interfaces
  Optional to Avoid NullPointerExceptions

* Functional programming (FP) 
  is a programming paradigm where computation is treated as the evaluation of mathematical functions and the avoidance of changing state or mutable data.

  Functional programming is a way of writing programs where:
  You use functions to do all the work.
  You avoid changing variables or data once they’re set.
  No changing values (everything stays the same once created).
  No side effects (functions don’t affect anything outside themselves).
  Functions are treated like values (you can pass them around).

  Cleaner, more concise code
  Fewer bugs related to mutable state
  Better support for concurrency and parallelism

  They enable functional programming style — treating behavior (functions) as values

* Functional Interface
  A functional interface in Java is an interface that has exactly one abstract method.
  Functional Interfaces were introduced in Java 8
  These are used primarily to enable lambda expressions and method references in Java 8 and later.
  Purpose: It represents a single functionality (like a function) that you can implement using a lambda expression or method reference.

  Can have only one abstract method
  Can have default and static methods (Java 8+)
  Can be annotated with @FunctionalInterface (optional, but recommended)
  Built-in Functional Interfaces (in java.util.function)

* Lambda Expression
  A lambda expression in Java is a concise way to represent an anonymous function (i.e., a function without a name) that can be passed around—typically as a parameter to methods.
  (is a anonymous function - no name, no return type, no access modifier)

  Why Use Lambda Expressions?
  Reduce boilerplate code (e.g., no need for anonymous classes)
  Enhance readability
  Enable functional-style operations like those in Streams API
  Mostly it is used to implement functional interface
  Lambda expressions cannot be used with interfaces that have more than one abstract method.

  Before Java 8, Java didn’t have lambda expressions, 
  so if you wanted to implement an interface inline—especially a functional interface (one with just a single method)—you had to use an anonymous inner class.

  Basic Syntax : (parameters) -> { body }
  (String s) -> System.out.println(s)
  s -> System.out.println(s)

  Greeting greet = () -> { 
        System.out.println("Hello");
   }

  Since Greet is a functional interface and has only one abstract method.
  It is that method.
  and whenever we are doing (), it means we are calling that abstract method.

  So where are lambdas used?
    Lambda expressions can only be used where a functional interface is expected.
    Built-in functional interfaces (from java.util.function) like Predicate, Function, Consumer, etc.
    Custom functional interfaces that you define.
    Standard Java APIs that take functional interfaces, like:
    Runnable for threads
    Comparator for sorting
    Streams (filter, map, forEach, etc.)
    -> In Streams :
          Streams themselves are not functional interfaces.
          But all the stream operations use functional interfaces (like Predicate, Function, Consumer, etc.).
          That’s why lambda expressions work so well with streams — because the methods take functional interfaces as arguments.
          - filter expects a Predicate<T>, which is a functional interface
          - map takes a Function<T, R>
          - forEach expects a Consumer<T>

* Anonymous Class
  An anonymous class in Java is a local class without a name.
  It allows you to define and instantiate a class at the same time, usually for one-time use, especially when implementing interfaces or abstract classes.
  To override methods of a class or interface without creating a separate named class.
  Can't have constructors.

  Eg : 
  interface( greeting ) -> void say(String msg);
  
  class HelloGreeting implements Greeting {
      @Override
      public void say(String message) {
          System.out.println("Hello, " + message);
      }
   }

  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Greeting greet = new HelloGreeting();
          greet.say("Alice");
      }
  }

  Before Java 8 (No Lambda Expression, Using Anonymous class)-> 

  @FunctionalInterface
  interface Greeting {
      void say(String message);
  }

  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          // Using an anonymous class
          Greeting greet = new Greeting() {
              @Override
              public void say(String message) {
                  System.out.println("Hello, " + message);
              }
          };
        
          greet.say("Alice");
      }
  }

  After Java 8 (Using Lambda Expression)

    @FunctionalInterface
    interface Greeting {
      void say(String message);
    }

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Using a lambda expression
            Greeting greet = msg -> System.out.println("Hello, " + msg);

            greet.say("Alice");
        }
    }

  In lambda expressions, the use of the **return** statement depends on whether the lambda has a single expression or a block body.

  Greeting greet = msg -> "Hello, " + msg;

  Greeting greet = msg -> {
      String message = "Hello, " + msg;
      return message;
  };

  Thread t1 = new Thread( () -> {
      for ( int i=0; i<10; i++ ){
            System.out.println("Hello World");
      }
  } );

  interface MathOperation{
      int operate(int a, int b);
  }

  MathOperation sumOperation = (a,b) -> a+b;
  MathOperation subOperation = (a,b) -> a-b;
  int sum = sumOperation(2,4);
  int diff = sumOperation(4,1);

  Lambda expression can be put into reference of any functional interface.
  Reference of functional interface can hold lambda expression.

* Default Method
  A default method in Java is a method defined inside an interface with a default implementation.
  It was introduced in Java 8 to allow developers to add new methods to interfaces without breaking the classes that already implement them.

  Why Default Methods?
  Before Java 8, interfaces could only have abstract methods (no method body). That meant:

  If you added a new method to an interface, every class implementing it would break, because they'd need to implement that new method.
  Default methods solve this by allowing a method with a body (implementation) in the interface.

  interface MyInterface {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("This is a default method.");
    }
  }

  A class can override a default method.

* Static Methods in Interfaces (Java 8+)
  A static method in Java is a method that belongs to a class or interface itself, rather than to instances (objects) of that class or interface. 
  This means you can call it without creating an object.

  Static methods are commonly used in utility or helper classes (e.g., Math, Collections).
  You cannot access non-static (instance) variables directly from a static method.
  Why?
      When you call a static method, there's no object instance available — it's being executed in the context of the class, not any specific object.
      But instance (non-static) variables belong to an object, so the static method doesn't know which object’s variable to refer to.
      A static method cannot access anything that requires an instance, unless you explicitly create or receive an instance of the class.  
  You can call other static methods or access static variables within a static method.
  We can access static variables from non-static methods in Java.

  Before Java 8, interfaces could not have any method implementations. 
  Java 8 introduced static methods in interfaces as a way to include helper or utility methods that are tied to the interface but not to any instance.

* Predicate 
  Is a functional interface.
  Has boolean value function, boolean test(T t);
  T is the type of input the predicate checks.
  The method boolean test(T t) returns true or false depending on whether the input matches a condition.

  1. Predicate<String> – works with strings:
     Predicate<String> isLong = s -> s.length() > 5;

     System.out.println(isLong.test("Apple"));     // false
     System.out.println(isLong.test("Bananas")); 
     Here, T is String

  2. Predicate<Integer> – works with numbers:
     Predicate<Integer> isEven = num -> num % 2 == 0;

     System.out.println(isEven.test(4));  // true
     System.out.println(isEven.test(7));  // false
     Here, T is Integer.

  you can combine two Predicate<String> instances to check if a string starts AND ends with a certain letter.

  Step 1: Define the two predicates
  Predicate<String> startsWithA = s -> s.startsWith("A");
  Predicate<String> endsWithZ = s -> s.endsWith("Z");

  Step 2: Combine with and()
  Predicate<String> startsAndEnds = startsWithA.and(endsWithZ);

  Step 3: Test with some strings
  System.out.println(startsAndEnds.test("ABZ"));    // true (starts with A, ends with Z)
  System.out.println(startsAndEnds.test("AZ"));     // true
  System.out.println(startsAndEnds.test("BZ"));     // false (does not start with A)
  System.out.println(startsAndEnds.test("AB"));     // false (does not end with Z)

* Function
  It is a functional interface introduced in java 8
  Have methods like apply(), compose(), andThen()
  @FunctionalInterface
  public interface Function<T, R>{
      R apply(T t);
  }

  <T> – the type of the input to the function 
  <R> – the type of the result of the function

        Function<Integer, Integer> doubleIt = x -> x*2;
        System.out.println(doubleIt.apply(20));
        Function<Integer, Integer> tripleIt = x -> x*3;
        System.out.println(tripleIt.apply(20));
        System.out.println(doubleIt.andThen(tripleIt).apply(20));

        System.out.println(doubleIt.compose(tripleIt).apply(20)); // first triples it, then doubles it

        Function<Integer, Integer> identity = Function.identity();
        System.out.println(identity.apply(5));

* Consumer
  It is a functional interface
  Will take input, won't return anything. Instead will use that input
  Have methods like accept(), andThen() -> modifies in sequence

  @FunctionalInterface
  public interface Consumer<T> {

    /**
     * Performs this operation on the given argument.
     *
     * @param t the input argument
     */
    void accept(T t);
   }

    Consumer c = s-> System.out.println(s);
    c.accept("Consum");
    c.accept(5);

        List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1,2,3);
        Consumer<List<Integer>> consumer = x -> {
            for ( int i : x){
                System.out.println(i);
            }
        };

        consumer.accept(list);

* Supplier
  Doesn't take anything as input, only returns

  @FunctionalInterface
  public interface Supplier<T> {

      /**
       * Gets a result.
       *
       * @return a result
       */
      T get();
  }

  Supplier<String> supplier = () -> "Hello World!";
  System.out.println(supplier.get());

* Combination of all

        Predicate<Integer> predicate = x -> x%2==0;
        Function<Integer, Integer> function = x -> x*x;
        Consumer<Integer> consumer = x -> System.out.println(x);
        Supplier<Integer> supplier = () -> 100;

        if (predicate.test(supplier.get()))
        {
            consumer.accept(function.apply(supplier.get()));
        }

  Predicate, Consumer, Supplier takes 1 arguments.  
  But there are some methods which take 2 arguments as well
  // Bi

  BiPredicate
  BiPredicate<Integer, Integer> biPredicate = (x, y) -> (x + y) % 2 == 0;
  System.out.println(biPredicate.test(5, 5));

  BiConsumer
  BiConsumer<String, Integer> biConsumer = (x, y) -> System.out.println(x + " has " + y + " Missiles.");
  biConsumer.accept("Ram", 10);

  BiFunction
  BiFunction<String, String, Integer> biFunction = (x, y) -> (x + y).length();
  System.out.println(biFunction.apply("Tokyo", "Koyto"));

  UnaryOperator -> extends Function<T,T>
  No need to repeat Function<Integer, Integer>

  BinaryOperator
  extends BiFunction<T,T,T> -> Used when all 3 are of same data types

  BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> sum = (x, y) -> (x + y);
  System.out.println(sum.apply(2, 3));

  UnaryOperator<Integer> unaryOperator = x -> x * 2;
  BinaryOperator<Integer> binaryOperator = (x, y) -> (x + y);
